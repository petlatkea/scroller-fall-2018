    <h1 id="scroller">This is a quite long text, that scrolls across the screen, one character at a time. 
        Back in the early days of the web, there was an HTML-tag for this kind of stuff, called &lt;marquee&gt;
        - surprisingly it still works in modern browsers, but of course it is not part of HTML5,
        certainly not semantic in any way, and won't be accepted by any validator.
        Anyways, scrolling texts, or simply scrolltexts were all the rage back in the 80ies, when screens
        were small, and we didn't have scroll-wheels or touchpads with multi-touch technology - we didn't even
        have mice! You young people of today, you have it way to easy - we also had to walk at least 10 kilometers
        to school every morning, in the snow, all year round! And come home to work in the factory, for 14 hour 
        workdays, with a sixpence in pay every other week!
